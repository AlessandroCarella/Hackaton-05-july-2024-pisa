# In this folder there are some throwaway code folder that we took from our data mining 2 project

* the balancing folder was actually used for the smote oversampling and you can find the code that we used in the balancing/balancing.ipynb file. 

    In the balancing/resampled folder there are the results of the decision trees trained based on the various disposition of the over/undersampling methods used. 
    
    In the balancing/resampled/based.json are the results of the decision trees with the original dataset

* the gmboost dm2 folder is used just to have reference code for the training and hyperparameters tuning of the model (the content of it is the raw content of the data mining project)

* the misc folder has the file used to check for missing values in the dataset (none)
