# In this folder you can find the files where we ran the explainability methods for our black box models

The jupyter files with just the name of the method are the ones we actually used and reported about

The files with the name of the method and "random forest" exist because we tried and successfully ran the methods also on random forest but we decided to not report on them because of time and space reasons.
